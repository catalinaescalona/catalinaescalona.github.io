  Talks with creative coders about web art and interactive exhibitions
---

<i>Status update for Week 11 on my journey to learn creative coding, as part of the University of Colorado Boulder's "Professional Development in Computer Science" course.</i>

## What did I do last week?

I prepared for and had an informational-turned-job interview for a creative producer position for a studio focusing on digital art and interactive exhibitions. As part of the interview prep, I did research on a "tender" example they sent me and organized my thoughts on possible exhibition proposal ideas. In addition, I did some research on vvvv, which is a visual live-programming environment that this studio and many creative coders use, at least in Europe. I also had a Zoom call with an artist-coder (and graduate of the CSPB program in 2022!), who recommended some artists and websites to research regarding web art and the "handmade web".

## What do I plan to do this week?

This week I want to change up the creative coding tutorials I've been watching and try out the "How to Code Generative Art" YouTube tutorial playlist from Steve's Makerspace. I also want to start drafting the Final Project Report for this class!

## Any impediments in my way?

I need to prepare for exams and final projects for my other classes, but this is part of the usual juggling of CSPB courses this summer. 

## Reflection on the process?

I've really enjoyed talking to several different people in the artistic / creative coding space. This class has been a great opportunity to finally take the time to invest in networking, learning from others, and researching special topics in the creative coding world.

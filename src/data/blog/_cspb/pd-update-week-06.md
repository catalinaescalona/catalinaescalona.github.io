<i>Status update for Week 6 on my journey to learn creative coding, as part of the University of Colorado Boulder's "Professional Development in Computer Science" course.</i>

## What did I do last week?

Unfortunately this past week was very packed with work deadlines, a lab, and an exam. I also got sick and had to take two days off, so my progress has been quite slow. Regarding creative coding, I finished the Coding Train “Chapter 2” tutorial videos. For the networking part, I reached out to two people working in the creative coding space.

## What do I plan to do this week?

I want to do some more research and make a list of more creative coders to contact. I also want to start on “Chapter 3” and make my own creative coding sketches. I would also like to spend some time updating my LinkedIn.

## Any impediments in my way?

As usual, time. Work is very busy with some major deadlines due before July 1st, and I’ve got another exam coming up in a CSPB course next week.

## Reflection on the process?

I need to review the mitigation strategies I outlined in my project proposal, to see what I can do as the “bare minimum” for times like this past week where I got sick and fell behind.

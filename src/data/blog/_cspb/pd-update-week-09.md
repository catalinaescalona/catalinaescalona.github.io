  Prep for a job interview for a creative coding university course

<i>Status update for Week 9 on my journey to learn creative coding, as part of the University of Colorado Boulder's "Professional Development in Computer Science" course.</i>

## What did I do last week?

This week I worked on the "Access Lifelong Resources" report, had a very informative and inspiring Zoom call with a professor at CU Boulder's ATLAS Institute about creative coding, and I applied for a job teaching a creative coding course at an art university in Linz, near Vienna! I also set up an informational interview with a creative producer for a digital art & interactive media studio in Vienna that will take place in two weeks. I have to say, investing time in updating my online professional presence has really paid off. For instance, regarding the creative coding teaching job, I was actually contacted directly about the position - they thought I'd be a good fit and should send in my application materials officially. :)

## What do I plan to do this week?

I plan to continue with more tutorials from The Coding Train, prep for the job interview next week regarding the creative coding university lecturer position, and work on updating my Handshake profile.

## Any impediments in my way?

Time. But since we're almost at the end of the semester, I can now count on one hand the number of remaining exams and assignments left (what a great feeling!). This has actually motivated me to finish as much as I can as soon as possible in my other classes, so I can spend more time on creative coding and professional development.  

## Reflection on the process?

Networking and reaching out to people is the way!

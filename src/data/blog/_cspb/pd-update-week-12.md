<i>Status update for Week 12 on my journey to learn creative coding, as part of the University of Colorado Boulder's "Professional Development in Computer Science" course.</i>

## What did I do last week?

I watched a few videos from the "How to Code Generative Art" YouTube tutorial playlist, fell down a research rabbit hole of artistic / experimental / abstract / poetic games, coordinated one more Zoom call with a creative coding studio in Vienna before the semester ends, and took notes on what I'd like to include in the Final Project Report.

## What do I plan to do this week?

I want to code a few tiny sketches in p5.js, prep and conduct the last creative coder Zoom call for the semester, and finish the Final Project Report.

## Any impediments in my way?

Exams and final projects for my other classes, plus some traveling. 

## Reflection on the process?

Drafting the Final Project Report has been a lot of fun - it's amazing to see how much I learned this semester!

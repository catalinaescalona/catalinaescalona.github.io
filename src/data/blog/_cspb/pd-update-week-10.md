  Prep for a job interview as a creative producer for interactive art exhibitions

<i>Status update for Week 10 on my journey to learn creative coding, as part of the University of Colorado Boulder's "Professional Development in Computer Science" course.</i>

## What did I do last week?

This past week I prepared for and had a job interview to potentially teach an Intro to Creative Coding class at a local art university. Also, an informational interview that I scheduled for next week has now actually turned into a job interview! The position would be as a creative producer for digital art and interactive exhibitions. They sent me a task to prepare, where I need to closely read a sample "tender" (an invitation from a foundation to submit exhibition ideas) and come up with a proposal.

## What do I plan to do this week?

This week I need to prepare the task described above, for the creative producer job interview. In addition, over the weekend I have a Zoom call scheduled with an artist-coder focusing on web art. I'm looking forward to hearing more about her practice and see if she has any creative coding tips and resources.

## Any impediments in my way?

Not this week! 

## Reflection on the process?

Although I haven't worked as much on the artistic-coding practice this semester as I'd hoped, I'm surprised that investing time in reaching out to people and setting up Zoom calls has resulted in two job interviews in the field I'd like to eventually pivot into (and this is without even actively seeking a job!).

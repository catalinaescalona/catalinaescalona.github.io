<i>Status update for Week 8 on my journey to learn creative coding, as part of the University of Colorado Boulder's "Professional Development in Computer Science" course.</i>

## What did I do last week?

This week was great for the networking / professional development side of the project! I reached out to 3 more people, I set up a Zoom call with a creative coding professor for next week, I went to the local art university's end of the academic year festival and saw some great digital artworks, and I watched two courses on LinkedIn Learning.

## What do I plan to do this week?

I plan to write up the report from the LinkedIn Learning courses, continue with more tutorials from The Coding Train, prep for and conduct the Zoom call scheduled for next week, and work on updating my LinkedIn / Handshake.

## Any impediments in my way?

No surprises here: time. Also, I find myself gravitating more towards the networking / professional development activities more than the creative coding learning right now. Since I'm about to graduate, I'm finding it more important to clean up my online presence to showcase what I've accomplished in the CSPB program. At the same time, I often feel like the coding I have to do for my other CSPB classes is "more important" right now than creative coding. I think I'll feel more calm and inspired after graduating at the end of the summer to dedicate time to creative coding, when I'm not juggling so many things. 

## Reflection on the process?

I'm finding it really useful to spend time writing / reflecting upon projects or courses that I've done and making that more public, liked through LinkedIn posts. I want to dedicate more time to this, so it's more clear to others what I'm up to and what I'm learning.

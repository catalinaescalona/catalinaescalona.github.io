  Status update for Week 4 on my journey to learn creative coding.

<i>Status update for Week 4 on my journey to learn creative coding, as part of the University of Colorado Boulder's "Professional Development in Computer Science" course.</i>

## What did I do last week?

I spent a good amount of time learning how to implement an Astro template on my GitHub Page, and it’s finally set up! The blog posts / status updates themselves are currently hidden, because I still need to edit the formatting a bit, but I’m glad the template and the custom domain are set up and working as they should. I also went through the [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js) “Chapter 1” videos to get an initial understanding and familiarization of p5.js. And of course, I spent some time reviewing the proposals of my peers!

## What do I plan to do this week?

I plan to continue with “Chapter 2” of the Coding Train video tutorials and make my first creative coding sketch. I also want to write up a template email for reaching out to creative coders and, if time permits, send it out to one person already.

## Any impediments in my way?

As usual, time management. This week has been especially hectic because of 2 upcoming exams in my other CSPB courses.

## Reflection on the Process?

It seems I need to factor in more time than I would initially think into my weekly planning for this course. For example, this past week, I thought implementing the Astro template would take me only 30 minutes. But it ended up taking me 2 hours because I encountered some issues and needed to do some digging online to solve the problem. It got solved! But of course, it took more time than planned. To the extent that it's possible, I need to plan for the unplanned / unforseeable obstacles that could arise.

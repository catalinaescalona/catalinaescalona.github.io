  Getting into the Coding Train tutorial
---

<i>Status update for Week 5 on my journey to learn creative coding, as part of the University of Colorado Boulder's "Professional Development in Computer Science" course.</i>

## What did I do last week?

I worked on my personal website, writing my About page and a short intro to the blog. I also edited the formatting of the blog post / status updates. Regarding creative coding, I went through half of the Coding Train “Chapter 2” tutorial videos. As for the networking part, I wrote a draft of an email to a creative coder, but I haven’t sent it yet. 

## What do I plan to do this week?

I plan to finish “Chapter 2” of the Coding Train tutorial, possibly start “Chapter 3”, and make my first creative coding sketch(es). I also want to send out the email I drafted and decide on the next creative coder to contact.

## Any impediments in my way?

Time! I have an exam coming up next week in one CSPB class and a Lab due in another, so I will need to spend a significant portion of my time on those classes.

## Reflection on the Process?

I think I need to regularly review my project proposal, to remember what tangible outcomes I want to have by the end of the semester.

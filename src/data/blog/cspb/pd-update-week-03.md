<i>Status update for Week 3 on my journey to learn creative coding, as part of the University of Colorado Boulder's "Professional Development in Computer Science" course.</i>

## What did I do last week?

For the scope of this project, I decided to focus on p5.js as my creative coding tool for the coming weeks. I selected a few tutorials to follow and focused on writing my project proposal. Additionally, as part of the networking portion, I spent some time researching and making a list of creative coders with whom I'd like to get in contact (for example from CU Boulder's [ATLAS Institute](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/)!). I was also looking into how to implement an Astro template for my GitHub Page. 

## What do I plan to do this week?

For the practical coding part, I plan to get started with the Coding Train tutorial and finish setting up my GitHub pages with Astro. For the networking part, I want to reach out to two creative coders via email to ask them about how they got started, what tools they use, what projects they are currently working on, and if they have any recommendations for resources / other artists to look at / etc. 

## Any impediments in my way?

Time management! Since I'm working full-time and taking two other CSPB classes simultaneously, I find that I can only really dedicate the 3-5 hours/week for this course on the weekends. Which is ok! But I prefer to keep some kind of momentum with the topic, instead of trying to get back into it after several days away.

## Reflection on the Process?

Since I would ideally like to be more consistent with the topic of creative coding, instead of only working on it over the weekend, maybe I can try to invest 30-60 minutes/day instead.
